# FreePass Data — NEXT START HERE

Status: **ACTIVE / CATALOG V1 EXECUTABLE BASELINE**  
Official project name: **프리패스 데이터 / FreePass Data**  
Repository: `freepass-creator/freepass-data`  
Verified main revision when this handoff was created: `6ee24326bd30b3420d04c4fe344ac9ad5dbfe769`  
Date: 2026-09-20

## 1. Do not restart or recreate the project

This repository already exists and contains the Catalog V1 executable baseline.

Do **not** create a replacement repository and do **not** redirect this work to `JPK ERP5/jpkerp5`.

Legacy Firebase identifiers may still appear as source/target identifiers. They are identifiers, not the official project name.

## 2. Locked boundaries

- Approved implementation scope: **CATALOG V1 ONLY**
- FreePass Data owns the server-side data-platform boundary, not Sales/Admin/Estimate business workflow meaning.
- Consumer apps must not treat internal Firestore collection paths as their public contract.
- Canonical writes fail closed when revision/authority/persistence validation cannot be performed.
- RTDB: **no new usage**. Existing traces are migration debt only.
- GitHub Actions / deployment automation: **do not add or enable without separate authorization**.
- Production Firebase binding, IAM change, writer cutover, schedule activation, and real-data writes remain separately authorized operations.

## 3. What is already on main

The current baseline includes:

- TypeScript / Node 22 modular monolith
- Catalog JSON Schemas
- VehicleModel / VehicleAsset / Product / Offer / PriceTerm / Policy domain
- memory + Firestore repository adapters
- revision conflict protection
- idempotency receipt
- append-only audit + transactional outbox
- worker lease/retry/dead-letter behavior
- ERP public projection + release activation
- Fastify API baseline
- legacy `freepasserp3` read-only adapter
- conservative legacy normalizer
- source run / RAW / normalized candidate persistence
- guarded legacy product ingestion job
- explicit target Firebase binding requirement
- shadow migration/comparison contract
- default-deny Firestore rules baseline + indexes
- fail-closed public projection for incomplete deposit terms
- tests covering catalog mutation, ingestion, normalizer and shadow behavior

## 4. Highest-value next work

### P0 — Field Authority Registry ✅

Implemented baseline: `src/domain/authority.ts`, command enforcement, authority evidence in receipt/audit, and regression tests.

Minimum dimensions:

- domain / aggregate / field path
- semantic owner
- allowed command(s)
- allowed writer/service identity class
- approval requirement
- conflict policy
- override policy
- effective-time policy
- source refresh behavior

Do not reduce this to a single `SOURCE_WINS`-style enum.

### P1 — Field-level lineage ✅

Catalog V1 now has RAW → normalized → canonical → projection lineage, exact Release manifests, source-run safety, reviewed canonicalization, queryable Canonical Revision History, and controlled Manual Catalog Source/Command.

Reviewed source-change update for existing canonical bindings is implemented.

Duplicate/out-of-order delivery behavior is implemented.

Writer ownership-transfer enforcement is implemented as a non-production semantic boundary.

Next implementation focus: authenticated service/user identity and IAM enforcement, then the ERP.com shadow/read pilot.

Minimum evidence:

- source_id
- source_record_id
- source revision/digest
- normalizer/mapper version
- canonical entity + revision
- field path
- source value / normalized value / canonical value
- override/correction reference when applicable

### P2 — Acceptance tests

Promote the architecture-v2 review test matrix into executable tests, starting with:

- [x] idempotency key reused with a different payload must conflict — implemented in PR #3
- [ ] stale revision must fail without losing the operator input
- [x] incomplete deposit/price pair must not be published
- [x] partial projection/evidence build must not replace last-known-good ACTIVE release
- [x] current reviewed candidate canonicalization must pin accepted source head
- [x] changed source fingerprint must require explicit re-review
- [x] reviewed source refresh must apply only the exact current diff set
- [x] structural/identity source changes must block partial refresh
- [x] stale review must fail when any pinned Canonical revision changed
- [x] source supplier code must be compared through binding mapping, not Canonical supplierId
- [x] missing critical lineage must block Canonical promotion
- [x] canonical create/change must append a queryable revision snapshot
- [x] direct manual entry must create immutable source evidence before Canonical commit
- [x] manual entry idempotency replay must not duplicate source evidence
- [x] ACTIVE Release must carry exact Canonical input revisions and digests
- [x] projection fields must resolve to source lineage or Canonical Revision History
- [x] source collection failure/incomplete coverage must not be interpreted as mass deletion
- [x] late older source run must not replace the accepted current head
- [x] duplicate / out-of-order event behavior
- [x] old writer blocked after ownership transfer (design + non-production enforcement test)

### P3 — Security/IAM review

Writer ownership transfer semantics are implemented, but runtime writer identity is not yet cryptographically authenticated.

Next:
- authenticate service/user identity
- bind execution writer to verified runtime identity rather than request metadata
- keep Firestore default deny
- define consumer read boundary before any production cutover

### P4 — ERP.com pilot consumer

Only after P0-P3 contracts are stable:

`LEGACY → SHADOW → FREEPASS_DATA_READ`

Do not perform writer cutover in the same step.

## 5. 2026-09-22 AI Core audit — Codex/Work immediate packet

This section is the current cross-project handoff from the AI Core/Data Hub audit.

Audit subject revision observed: `fea18ce15f523d41a9382e7ae79e702a58d3afae`.

### P0-A — Production runtime must fail closed

Current code defaults `FREEPASS_DATA_DRIVER` to `memory` and seeds demo catalog data. This is acceptable for local/test, but production must never silently boot with memory/demo data.

Required:
- introduce an explicit runtime environment/mode;
- production must require an explicit persistent driver;
- production must refuse memory/demo seeding;
- split liveness from readiness;
- readiness must verify target data binding, required ownership/security state and a readable last-known-good ACTIVE release;
- do not report production-ready merely because the HTTP process is alive.

Primary files:
- `src/bootstrap.ts`
- `src/api/server.ts`
- `.env.example`

### P0-B — Separate the serving plane from projection building

Current API startup calls `buildErpPublicProjection(...)`. This couples the read-serving process to a fresh projection build.

Target:
`Canonical -> Builder/Worker -> validated Release -> ACTIVE pointer -> Read API -> Consumer`

Required:
- remove mandatory projection rebuild from API startup;
- API read path must serve the last-known-good ACTIVE release;
- builder/worker owns projection/release creation;
- a failed new build must not make an already valid ACTIVE release unavailable;
- add regression coverage proving read availability survives a failed new projection build.

Primary files:
- `src/api/server.ts`
- `src/application/catalog.ts`
- `src/worker.ts`

### P0-C — Harden Catalog writer ownership

Writer ownership transfer is implemented, but absent stored ownership currently resolves to the implicit `SHARED_MIGRATION` compatibility state.

Required:
- keep implicit shared migration only for explicitly declared non-production migration mode;
- after production cutover, missing/corrupt ownership state must block Canonical writes;
- runtime writer identity must eventually come from verified auth/IAM, not request semantics;
- ownership recovery/restore behavior must be testable.

Primary files:
- `src/domain/writer-ownership.ts`
- `src/application/writer-ownership.ts`
- Firestore ownership persistence/tests.

### P0-D — Enforce exact Firebase target binding

`FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` has no default, which is directionally correct, but the runtime must positively verify the expected target before production activation.

Required:
- require explicit target project ID in persistent mode;
- fail readiness on missing/unknown target;
- bind service identity/environment/project evidence into readiness;
- no production writer activation from a loosely inherited Application Default Credential context.

### P0-E — Fix F01/F03 authority drift before consumer cutover

Live sheet observation on 2026-09-22:

F01:
- title: `[F01 사용중] 프리패스 상품리스트`
- visible current tabs included `상품리스트 09.21 18:13 · 385대`, `손오공상품 · 58대`, `픽업구독 · 221대`, `오플구독 · 54대`.
- hidden `이 시트는` content still describes the old flow where the sales sheet/product master effectively feed ERP as operational truth.

F03:
- title: `[F03 사용중] 차종마스터 신규`
- `SSOT 운영기준` correctly says FreePass Data VehicleModel/VehicleAsset is Canonical SSOT and F03 is reviewed source/reference only.

This is an authority-description conflict.

Required:
- F01 must be classified as projection/operational view, not Canonical authority;
- F03 remains reviewed source/reference;
- update the generator/source that writes F01's `이 시트는` text rather than hand-editing the generated tab;
- do not let sheet display labels become machine identity.

Cross-repo source:
- `freepass-creator/freepasserp4/lib/domain/sheet-identity.ts`
- `freepass-creator/freepasserp4/scripts/publish-sheet-identity-tab.mts`

### P0-F — Fix machine key vs display-label coupling

Current `freepasserp4/lib/domain/sales-published-tabs.ts` expects prefixes:
- 상품리스트
- 손오공구독
- 픽업구독
- 오플구독

Live F01 currently exposes `손오공상품 · 58대`.

Because the selector uses prefix matching, code paths using that contract can omit the live Sonogong tab.

Required:
- define a stable machine key (for example `subscription_sonogong`) independent from the visible tab title;
- keep human labels free to change without changing identity;
- add compatibility mapping for current/legacy labels;
- add tests with the live current labels before changing production sheet generation;
- do not rename live tabs as the first fix unless parity impact is measured.

### P1 — Refresh AI Core / DevCenter observation evidence

DevCenter Data Hub evidence currently pins an older FreePass Data revision (`bd75b604...`). The audited FreePass Data head is five commits ahead and includes reviewed source changes, projection delivery idempotency and writer ownership hardening.

Required after P0 code changes:
- regenerate/re-evaluate Data Hub revision-bound receipt on the exact new head;
- refresh consumer/recovery evidence without hiding remaining IAM/backup HOLDs;
- register/update the FreePass Data Project Capsule so AI Core can resolve repository, SSOT, commands, deployment boundaries and blockers without rediscovery.

### Required execution discipline

- Do not perform production Firebase writer cutover, live sheet mutation, IAM change, deploy automation activation or RTDB reintroduction as part of this packet.
- Work in the owning repository for each concern. Do not copy project SSOT into AI Core.
- Make the smallest isolated changes and preserve exact revision evidence.
- Run repository checks/tests after each isolated change.
- Leave exact commit/test/result/remaining-HOLD evidence in this handoff and GitHub issue #24.

### Suggested implementation order

1. P0-A runtime fail-closed.
2. P0-B serving/build separation.
3. P0-C/P0-D ownership + binding hardening.
4. Cross-repo F01 authority/identity correction with tests.
5. Exact-head Data Hub receipt refresh.
6. Only after those pass: ERP.com shadow-read parity pilot.

## 6. Coordination rule

Before each new change:

1. read `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`
2. read this file
3. verify current `main` revision
4. check open PRs/branches for overlapping work
5. make the smallest isolated change
6. leave an updated next-start-here note when the work packet ends

This file exists so another session can continue without re-discovering or re-creating the project.
